# Multimodal Features: PDF & Image Processing

Your agent now has **multimodal capabilities** to process PDFs and images alongside web search. This enables handling questions that reference documents, charts, diagrams, and visual content.

## 🎯 What's New

### 1. **PDF Processing** (`fetch_pdf`)
- Extract text from PDFs with **page-aware citations**
- Support both local files and URLs
- Extract metadata (title, author, dates)
- Enable precise quotes like "According to page 12..."

### 2. **Image Analysis** (`analyze_image`)
- Analyze images using **Gemini vision models**
- Extract text from images (OCR)
- Describe visual content
- Specialized functions for charts and documents

### 3. **Multi-Modal Orchestration**
- Agent can combine web search + PDF analysis + image analysis
- Cross-reference information across modalities
- Citations work across all sources

## 📦 New Tools Available

### PDF Tools

#### `fetch_pdf(path_or_url, max_pages=None, extract_metadata=True)`
Extracts text content from PDFs with page numbers.

**Example:**
```python
result = fetch_pdf("https://example.com/report.pdf", max_pages=10)
print(f"Total pages: {result['total_pages']}")
print(f"First page: {result['pages'][0]['text']}")
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "pages": [{"page_num": 1, "text": "...", "char_count": 1234}, ...],
    "metadata": {"title": "...", "author": "...", "creation_date": "..."},
    "total_pages": 50,
    "source": "original_url_or_path"
}
```

#### `extract_quote_from_pdf(pdf_result, search_text, max_quote_length=120)`
Finds and extracts specific quotes from PDF results.

**Example:**
```python
quote = extract_quote_from_pdf(pdf_result, "climate change")
print(f"Found on page {quote['page_num']}: {quote['quote']}")
```

### Image Tools

#### `analyze_image(path_or_url, question=None, detail_level="medium")`
Analyzes images using Gemini vision.

**Example:**
```python
result = analyze_image("chart.png", question="What trend is shown?")
print(result['description'])
print(result['details'])
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "description": "Overall description",
    "details": "Detailed analysis",
    "objects": ["object1", "object2"],
    "text": "Any text detected (OCR)",
    "source": "original_path_or_url",
    "mime_type": "image/png"
}
```

#### `analyze_chart(path_or_url)`
Specialized for charts and graphs - extracts data points, trends, and insights.

#### `analyze_document(path_or_url)`
Specialized for document images (receipts, forms) - extracts structured information.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Test the Tools

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
uv run python test_multimodal.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Check that GOOGLE_API_KEY is configured
- ✅ Test PDF extraction with a sample document
- ✅ Test image analysis with a sample image
- ✅ Report any issues

### 2. Try in the Web UI

```bash
uv run adk web
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 and try questions like:

**PDF Questions:**
- "Can you read this PDF and summarize it?" (then upload a PDF)
- "What does page 5 of the report say about revenue?"

**Image Questions:**
- "What does this chart show?" (upload a chart image)
- "Describe this image" (upload any image)
- "What text is in this screenshot?" (OCR)

**Combined Questions:**
- "Compare what the PDF says on page 3 with current information from the web"
- "This chart shows sales data - what's the trend and how does it compare to industry averages?"

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Analyze a PDF Report

**User:** "What does this report say about Q4 earnings?"

**Agent workflow:**
1. Calls `fetch_pdf("earnings_report.pdf")`
2. Extracts text from all pages
3. Searches for "Q4 earnings" content
4. Extracts quotes with page numbers
5. Optionally web searches for verification
6. Returns cited answer: "According to page 12 of the report..."

### Example 2: Analyze a Chart

**User:** "What trend does this chart show?"

**Agent workflow:**
1. Calls `analyze_chart("revenue_chart.png")`
2. Extracts chart type, axes, data points
3. Identifies trend (increasing/decreasing)
4. Optionally web searches for context
5. Returns: "The chart shows revenue increasing from $10M to $15M (2020-2024)..."

### Example 3: Multi-Modal Question

**User:** "This PDF mentions a new product launch. Can you find more information about it online?"

**Agent workflow:**
1. Calls `fetch_pdf()` to read document
2. Extracts product name and details from PDF
3. Calls `web_search()` with product name
4. Cross-references PDF content with web sources
5. Returns comprehensive answer with citations from both sources

## 🎓 Agent Instructions

The agent has been instructed to:

✅ **Always include page numbers** when citing PDFs
✅ **Cross-reference** PDF/image content with web sources when needed
✅ **Acknowledge source type** (web vs. attachment) in citations
✅ **Extract data precisely** from charts and visualizations
✅ **Use OCR** to read text from images when needed

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **google.generativeai** - Already included with ADK for vision

### Files Created
- `my_agent/tools/fetch_pdf.py` - PDF processing tool
- `my_agent/tools/analyze_image.py` - Image analysis tool
- `test_multimodal.py` - Test script for verification

### Files Modified
- `my_agent/agent.py` - Added new tools and instructions

## 📊 Performance Notes

**PDF Processing:**
- Speed: ~1-2 seconds per page for extraction
- Works with: PDFs from URLs or local files
- Limitation: Very large PDFs (>100 pages) may be slow; use `max_pages` parameter

**Image Analysis:**
- Speed: ~2-3 seconds per image
- Works with: JPG, PNG, WebP, and most image formats
- Supports: Charts, diagrams, photos, screenshots, documents
- Gemini vision is quite capable - can read handwriting, understand complex diagrams

## 🎯 Use Cases for Hackathon

The hidden test set may include:

1. **Document Questions** - "What does this earnings report say about..."
2. **Chart Interpretation** - "What trend is shown in this graph?"
3. **Visual Puzzles** - "What do you see in this image?"
4. **Cross-Modal** - "Compare the data in this PDF with current web information"
5. **OCR Tasks** - "What text is in this screenshot?"

Your agent can now handle all of these! 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"PyPDF2 not installed" error:**
```bash
uv add PyPDF2
uv sync
```

**"GOOGLE_API_KEY not found" error:**
```bash
cd my_agent
# Edit .env and ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY is set
```

**PDF download fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify URL is accessible
- Try local file instead

**Image analysis returns generic descriptions:**
- Try more specific questions
- Use `detail_level="high"` for more detail
- Use specialized functions (`analyze_chart`, `analyze_document`)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Run these checks to ensure everything works:

- [ ] Run `uv run python test_multimodal.py` - all tests pass
- [ ] Start `uv run adk web` - no import errors
- [ ] Upload a sample PDF - agent can read it
- [ ] Upload a sample image - agent can describe it
- [ ] Try a multi-modal question - agent combines sources
